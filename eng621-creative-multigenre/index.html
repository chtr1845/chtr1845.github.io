                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Our perspective in how we view things is fundamental to how we navigate the world and grow as a person. Perspective changes how we receive experiences and how we then change our perspective due to those experiences creating a feedback loop that can either be to our benefit or our detriment. As humans with the ability to form very complex and interweaving views on our world that can evolve over time, we should pay close attention to how it evolves and take into consideration if the way we are changing is aligned with what we believe to be valuable and important. Oftentimes we can let ourselves go astray from what we truly value and get ourselves stuck into a situation where we can only view our situations in one polarizing way or in an ignorant light, to avoid this we must be wary to keep our perspectives in check. Understanding the perspectives of  others is one of the most beneficial ways to keep our perspective in check as it allows us to compare and contrast our views with the others around us who may have better insight or ideas on a situation or event than ourselves. Additionally by listening to others perspectives one may find that the views between each other may not be all that different or have interesting overlap we may have never noticed before which is why in my pieces I will be using the phrase  “What we both saw” in all my pieces to signify the overlap that can occur between differing perspectives.</p>
                        <p>For my first piece I choose to create a memoir reenacting a discussion of the polarizing views between me and one of my peers on the novel The Catcher in the Rye where we dissected how we interpreted the protagonist Holden, many of our views were very different but our overall view of the character ended up being very similar. This helps support the idea of how different polarizing views can be formed from the same topic as well as demonstrating how even though our more in depth ideas of character were conflicting we both had similar ideas on the same topic when viewed as a whole. For my second piece I have created a short story following a character who is battling with their negative view with the world around them and ends up changing their perspective on how they choose to live their life bringing new motivation and ambition. Demonstrating how we are able to adapt our perspectives over time and how our perspectives shape ourselves and our longevity as individuals. Finally for my last piece I created an interactive element of a cube that at first glance appears to be whole but once rotated in three dimensional space reveals its incomplete state. This piece demonstrates how we must continue to keep our minds open to grow to seek and gain new knowledge and understanding about the world around us to keep us from becoming ignorant and misinformed. All of these pieces demonstrate a key detail of how our perspectives must be open to adaptation to be able to not only become better versions of ourselves but become more informed about the world around us.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <span class="purple">One day I asked my classmate what they thought about The Catcher in the Rye, they said “I did not like it, Holden was <span class="italic purple">waay</span> too pessimistic”. I was bewildered to hear such a remark about such an astounding coming of age novel that had reduced it to the simplicity of it “being too negative”, we then proceeded to discuss our thoughts to gain insight on each other's views on the novel.</span>
                            <span class="red">They choose to view the novel as a boy having simply a negative view on the world who couldn’t just be happy and positive every once and a while or look at the positive side of things.</span>
                            <span class="blue">I choose to view the novel as a boy who yet didn’t see the good in the world but was determined over anything to see it.</span>
                            <span class="red">When they read the novel they saw someone who focused heavily on the negatives that you have to just accept in life, someone who wouldn’t just get over it.</span>
                            <span class="blue">When I read the novel I saw someone who couldn’t overlook the issues in his world, someone who wanted to know why the world was the way it was but was denied the answers.</span>
                            <span class="red">They saw a mind wandering and observations on how different people conveyed themselves as a clear sign of immaturity and demonstration of an inability to focus on what was important.</span>
                            <span class="blue">I saw a mind that could think freely and notice things in people that others may not notice or care about, a mind that wanted to understand people, a mind that was compassionate and always learning.</span>
                            <span class="red">Their view was that Holden didn’t want people to grow up because it made them bland and that everyone needed to entertain him.</span>
                        </p>
                        <div id="holden">
                            <p style="text-indent: 0;">
                                <span class="blue">My view was that Holden didn’t want people to lose their innocence, their wonder, their bliss, the things that make people joyful, interesting and eager to do great things with their lives.</span>
                                <span class="purple">What we both saw was a boy who didn’t know what to do with himself, someone who was emotionally troubled and disengaged with the public norms of dismissing the small things. Despite our differences in how we viewed Holden we both knew he had challenges mentally and emotionally to overcome and had to reach a point of self actualization and gain a determination to do better and bring inspiration to his world.</span>

                    <h2 id="fiction" class="title">He Who Drifted Away</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p><mark>He was notorious for his lack of motivation and unwillingness to push forward through daunting tasks. He never really cared about the world around him, in his mind it was all futile to even attempt to be positive as there was no fixing the state that he was in; a state of solidarity that irked them through their entire upbringing that never faded. No one in his family ever saw him, saw the work he put in to seek validation, the things he was truly interested in or the way he felt. Instead they would dismiss him and try to fill the void they created from absence with materialistic objects, drowning him in items he would never need nor want. But no one saw this part of him and he had no desire to share these things with others, if he did he might have been pushed further into the deep end of society.</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>After exhausting all avenues that he could think of to make his life better he opted to go with the only other option he had readily available to him which was to give up. Perhaps not the greatest choice in hindsight but what else was he going to do in a life that gave up on him? After giving up his life fell further into disarray but what was he losing? A life that was already dismissing him that didn’t care about his achievements or aspirations, a life that watched him drown and didn’t blink an eye? While he thought everything was over someone noticed him drowning, they wanted to know what pushed him off into the deep end but he was not going to budge, he spent too long keeping it all to himself to just shatter. Finally they pushed too far, and he did shatter but not in a way that leaked out the things he hid but the feelings he never felt, the feelings he avoided for so long.</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>Eventually he felt as if he was on his last breath with a magnificent weight pushing down on him keeping him stuck in his head unable to break free into the real waters that were slowly engulfing him to the point he could no longer breathe. Caving in, he decides to coincide with someone who he could always rely on in a time of need. He admitted things he never admitted to any other, things he scuffed down inside of him and covered up to avoid the damage that may ensue. To his dismay they understood something about himself that he never deemed important or worthy to talk about. In fact his confessee sees his detachment to these issues that he pushed away not giving another thought and saw them as vital components to what brought him to his current state as a person. They saw the fights, the concurring, the waves and whirlpools that no one else, even himself saw. They told him that he didn’t need to keep this all encapsulated inside himself, that there would always be people who would be able to get at least a drop of what he was going through and people who would care if he swam deep enough. Most importantly he told him to keep on swimming.</mark> He took it all at face value and came to the realization that if he could get through the biggest wave that could ever stand before him, the one that he created, there was no wave or obstacle that could prevent him from reaching a state of self actualization, a state of freedom.</p>
                        <p>He is someone I could never forget, someone who rose above everything that tried to stop him, someone who rose above himself. I wish I could let him know that everything would be ok, let him know that all the things he was doing was going to surmount to something, something he could never believe. Alas I will never be able to as we have drifted apart a distance so great that I will never be able to see him, at least not in the same light I once did nor in a short enough journey to be able to remember all the great things he did. If I do ever see him again though hopefully it won’t be for too long, I know it may sound sadistic in a way but I don’t know if I could live where he lived without falling apart into a multitude of pieces and having to pick it all back up. I know I will drift back towards him at least some amount, we always drift in that direction at some point but gaining back the control of your raft sooner or later is important to keeping ourselves in one piece. Despite being practically light years apart I can’t help but see the parts in him that reflect back on to me, the things that never changed between us. Although those things would never change in him I suppose, he isn’t the one who changed after all, he is just someone during one period of time.</p>
                        <p>Despite him never seeing things he went through as important, I now see them as some of the most important things in his life, at least they are the things that gave me a new friend who understood and related to what we went through. Additionally it gave me the strength to keep going, we went through so much that I doubt there is nothing I wouldn’t be able to do or face, I already did so many things he never thought of ever doing. Although there are many things that we disagree on, we both saw someone who needed help, he thought it could never be done but I now see that it was possible. I really should thank that person that grounded me, the person who listened as I was drowning and didn’t push me to say more than I needed to in the moments that I spoke to him. If it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t have drifted apart.</p>

                    <div class="content">

                        <p>At first you may have perceived the cube above as full and complete, at least that’s what it appeared to be at its initial angle. Although as you’ve become more aware of the ability to rotate the cube around you most likely revealed a daunting secret hidden behind the complete bliss brought on by the cube’s appearance. It is incomplete. It is as incomplete as your initial perception of the cube, a perception that had beliefs, reasoning and past experiences to back its claim to seem reliable. Once you rotated the cube and revealed its incompleteness it revealed the incompleteness in your blissful perspective on the cube, a perspective that did not give the entire picture but provided a general idea nonetheless. Your experiences of this cube demonstrates the need to adapt and grow your perspective, if you do not continue to do so your perception will also become incomplete similar to the cube leading to ignorance of vital information. A perspective of what you have on an intangible digital cube may not appear relevant but it can reveal the biases of our human consciousness. We as humans have many cognitive biases, one of which is the heuristic bias; the bias of immediate examples of a topic which can hinder our ability to perceive and create constructive perspectives. Obviously we’ve seen enough cubes to be able to see something that looks very similar to a cube and be able to label it as such so when we both saw an illusion of a cube our brain transferred that to our initial perception of reality which is why we can not rely on this to be a perfect tool, it is only there to guide us into a potentially correct direction. Overall we can not and should not rely on our first perception and perspective to guide us for the rest of our lives, if we do so we will never reveal the full picture and stay within a state of ignorant bliss.</p>
